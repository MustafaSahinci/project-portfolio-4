## agile
Agile is an approach to project management that centers around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects. The incremental parts of a project are carried out in short-term development cycles

I used the Canban board in github projects and issues which you can see 
[here](https://github.com/MustafaSahinci/project-portfolio-4/projects/1)

And I used the github Milestones for the sprints which you can see
[here](https://github.com/MustafaSahinci/project-portfolio-4/milestones)

- Create a webpage application using the Django framework.
- Use bootstrap to make the site responsive.
- Allow the user to create an account so that they can create their own post and profile.
- Allow logged in users add comments so they can communicate with each other
- Allow users to Crud(Create, Read, Update and Delete) their posts and profile.
